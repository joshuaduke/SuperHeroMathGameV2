## Description

I was assigned a similar project during my second semester at Seneca College. Version 1 was created with HTML, CSS3 and javascript. It was riddled with bugs and features that I never got to properly implement.

This is version 2 of that project. Through this version I wanted to learn more about DOM manipulation and Sass as well.
